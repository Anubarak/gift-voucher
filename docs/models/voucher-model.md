# Voucher Model

When you're on a single voucher template, or looping through vouchers using `craft.giftVoucher.vouchers()`, you're actually working with a `GiftVoucher_VoucherModel`. This in turn extends Commerce's [Purchasable](https://craftcommerce.com/docs/purchasables) object.

## Simple Output

Outputting a `GiftVoucher_VoucherModel` object in your template without attaching a property or method will return the productâ€™s name:

`<h1>{{ product }}</h1>`

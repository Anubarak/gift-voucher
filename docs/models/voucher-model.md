# Voucher Element

When you're on a single voucher template, or looping through vouchers using `craft.giftVoucher.vouchers()`, you're actually working with a `Voucher` element. This in turn extends Commerce's [Purchasable](https://docs.craftcms.com/commerce/v2/purchasables.html) object.

## Simple Output

Outputting a `Voucher` element in your template without attaching a property or method will return the productâ€™s name:

`<h1>{{ product }}</h1>`

Voucher elements have the following attributes and methods:

## Attributes

`title` | The voucher name/title.
`id` | The id of the voucher in the system.
`purchasableId` | Returns this vouchers id - as vouchers are purchasables.

`typeId` | The voucher's voucher type Id
